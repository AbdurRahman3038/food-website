                    Foodie is very responsive and better to use than grab I feel. Fees wise I feel its more responsible.
                    the customer service is also responsive and address problem within 15 mins.</p>

                    Their app is okay. However, the service is not that good. There was a time that they failed to notify me that one of the meals that I ordered was not available.</p>
